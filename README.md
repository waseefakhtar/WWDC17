# WWDC17
A simple iOS app for WWDC17 scholarship.

Making use of UILabel animations and a set of UIColor that WWDC landing page use, this is a simple app giving an overview of WWDC17 as the user taps on each UILabel. The UILabel animation used is an open source project at GitHub, named LTMorphingLabel. Along with Swift playground, Iâ€™ve also attached the project files and a screencast of the app as assets.
